# POST https://api.github.com/repos/ChanManChan/github-actions-test/dispatches <- when I send this request from postman, it will

# Body :-
# {
#   "event_type": "build" <- this can be anything
# }
#  <- we can even send a payload

# OR

# {
#     "event_type": "build",
#     "client_payload": {
#         "env": "production"  <- How to retrieve the client_payload in our workflow ? It'll be available in the "github" object
#     }
